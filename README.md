# Introduction 

It's a game where you have to guess a 3 digit number based on some clues.

# Clues :
When I say:    It Means:

Fermi          One digit is correct and in right position
Pico           One digit is correct but in wrong position
Bagels         No digit is correct

# Examples :

If your guess is 976 and the number is 674 then it will print 'Fermi Pico'.
